## Spec

### Problem

The `CreateTicketRequest` struct in `apm-server/src/main.rs` accepts only `title` and `sections`. It has no `epic` or `depends_on` fields, so the UI cannot create epic-linked or dependency-declared tickets via the API.

The `Frontmatter` struct in `apm-core/src/ticket.rs` also has no `epic`, `target_branch`, or `depends_on` fields. Because `TicketResponse` and `TicketDetailResponse` both serialize frontmatter via `#[serde(flatten)]`, adding these fields to `Frontmatter` is sufficient to make them appear in all existing ticket API read responses — no struct changes are needed in `apm-server`.

The `ticket::create` function must also be extended to accept and persist these three optional fields so the server (and the CLI in a future ticket) can populate them at creation time.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `GET /api/tickets` response includes `epic`, `target_branch`, and `depends_on` keys for a ticket that has those frontmatter fields set
- [ ] `GET /api/tickets/:id` response includes `epic`, `target_branch`, and `depends_on` keys for a ticket that has those frontmatter fields set
- [ ] `GET /api/tickets` response omits `epic`, `target_branch`, and `depends_on` for a ticket that does not have those fields (keys absent, not null)
- [ ] `POST /api/tickets` with `{"title": "T", "depends_on": ["ab12cd34"]}` creates a ticket whose frontmatter contains `depends_on = ["ab12cd34"]`
- [ ] `POST /api/tickets` with `{"title": "T", "epic": "ab12cd34"}` where branch `epic/ab12cd34-some-slug` exists creates a ticket with `epic = "ab12cd34"` and `target_branch = "epic/ab12cd34-some-slug"` in frontmatter
- [ ] `POST /api/tickets` with `{"title": "T", "epic": "ab12cd34"}` where no matching epic branch exists returns HTTP 400
- [ ] `POST /api/tickets` response body includes `epic`, `target_branch`, and `depends_on` when those fields were set
- [ ] Existing `POST /api/tickets` calls with no `epic` or `depends_on` fields continue to work unchanged

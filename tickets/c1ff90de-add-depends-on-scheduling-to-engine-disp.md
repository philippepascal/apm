## Spec

### Problem

Once `depends_on` is stored in ticket frontmatter (ticket d877bd37), the engine dispatch loop must honour it. Currently `pick_next` returns the highest-priority actionable ticket unconditionally — neither the dispatch loop in `spawn_next_worker` nor the `apm next` command has any awareness of ticket dependencies.

The full design is in `docs/epics.md` (§ depends_on scheduling — Engine loop change). Before a candidate ticket is dispatched, every entry in its `depends_on` list must be checked: if any referenced ticket exists and is not yet in state `implemented` or later, the candidate must be skipped and the next highest-scoring non-blocked ticket tried instead. An unknown dep ID (no matching ticket found) is treated as non-blocking. The check is config-driven: "implemented or later" means the dep ticket's state appears at the same position or later than `implemented` in `config.workflow.states`, or the dep ticket's state has `terminal = true`.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] When a ticket has `depends_on = ["<id>"]` and the referenced ticket is in a state before `implemented`, `spawn_next_worker` skips it and dispatches the next highest-priority non-blocked ticket instead
- [ ] When all entries in `depends_on` are in state `implemented` or later, the ticket is eligible for dispatch as normal
- [ ] A state with `terminal = true` satisfies the dependency check regardless of its position in the workflow states list
- [ ] A `depends_on` entry whose ID does not match any known ticket is treated as non-blocking (the candidate is not skipped due to that entry)
- [ ] A ticket with an empty `depends_on = []` is treated identically to a ticket with no `depends_on` field
- [ ] `apm next` skips dep-blocked tickets by the same rule — it returns the highest-scoring ticket whose deps are all satisfied
- [ ] The dep-blocking logic does not hardcode state names beyond `implemented` as the threshold; states that appear after `implemented` in the workflow states list also satisfy the check

### Out of scope

- Adding `depends_on` to `Frontmatter` — that is ticket d877bd37
- UI lock icon on ticket cards (separate UI ticket per the epic design)
- Circular dependency detection or warnings
- Changes to `apm list` output to surface blocked tickets
- `apm work --dry-run` output (ticket 18c00750 covers that separately)
- Epic-scoped filtering of the dispatch queue (separate ticket in the epic)

### Approach

This ticket depends on d877bd37 landing first (adds `depends_on: Option<Vec<String>>` to `Frontmatter`).

**1. Add `is_implemented_or_later` helper — `apm-core/src/ticket.rs`**

Add a pub function that takes `state: &str` and `states: &[crate::config::StateConfig]` and returns `bool`. It returns `true` if: (a) the state has `terminal = true`, or (b) the state's position in the list is >= the position of `"implemented"`. Returns `false` if the state is unknown.

**2. Extend `pick_next` signature — `apm-core/src/ticket.rs`**

Add `states: &[crate::config::StateConfig]` parameter after `startable`. Inside the existing `find` closure, add dep-block filtering: for each `dep_id` in `t.frontmatter.depends_on`, look up the dep ticket in `tickets`; if found and not `is_implemented_or_later`, the candidate is blocked (`return false`). Unknown dep IDs use `.unwrap_or(false)` — non-blocking.

The existing iterator already tries candidates in score order; adding this filter means it naturally falls through to the next candidate.

**3. Update call sites**

Three locations call `ticket::pick_next` — all have `config` in scope:

- `apm-core/src/start.rs` line ~319 (non-aggressive `spawn_next_worker`): add `&config.workflow.states`
- `apm-core/src/start.rs` line ~474 (main `spawn_next_worker`): add `&config.workflow.states`
- `apm/src/cmd/next.rs` line ~20: add `&config.workflow.states`

**4. Tests**

Unit tests in `apm-core/src/ticket.rs`:
- `is_implemented_or_later` returns `true` for `implemented`, for a state after it in the list, and for any `terminal = true` state
- `is_implemented_or_later` returns `false` for states before `implemented`
- `pick_next` skips a dep-blocked ticket and returns the next unblocked one
- `pick_next` returns a ticket once its dep is at `implemented`
- `pick_next` does not skip a ticket with an unknown dep ID
- `pick_next` does not skip a ticket with an empty `depends_on` list

Integration test in `apm/tests/integration.rs`:
- Set up two tickets (A in `ready`, B in `ready` with `depends_on = [A.id]`); `apm next` returns A
- After A is transitioned to `implemented`, `apm next` returns B

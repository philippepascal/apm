## Spec

### Problem

The `TransitionConfig` struct in `apm-core/src/config.rs` has no `outcome` field. Any tooling that needs to know whether a transition represents the worker's success path — mock wrappers, dead-end detection in `apm validate`, future UI colouring — must each re-implement the same inference from `CompletionStrategy` and `StateConfig.terminal`. That logic has a canonical definition in `docs/agent-wrappers.md` § "Transition outcomes," but it lives only in prose, not in code.

Adding `pub outcome: Option<String>` to `TransitionConfig` together with a single `resolve_outcome` helper centralises the inference once. Projects that want a more precise label (e.g. marking a transition to `ammend` as `rejected` rather than the inferred `needs_input`) can set the field explicitly; the helper returns the explicit value when present and falls back to the three-rule inference otherwise.

This ticket's scope is the data model and its rules. The field is deliberately inert in the current binary: mock wrappers that read it are a separate ticket (25c92daa). The value delivered here is (a) a stable, typed schema that downstream consumers can rely on without re-deriving the logic, (b) a `resolve_outcome` helper they can call directly, and (c) an annotated `workflow.toml` that makes the shipped default self-describing.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `TransitionConfig` has a `pub outcome: Option<String>` field with `#[serde(default)]` and a doc comment citing the five recognised values
- [ ] A public `resolve_outcome<'a>(transition: &'a TransitionConfig, target_state: &StateConfig) -> &'a str` function exists in `apm-core`
- [ ] `resolve_outcome` returns the explicit outcome string (as `&str`) when `transition.outcome` is `Some`
- [ ] `resolve_outcome` returns `"success"` when `outcome` is `None` and `transition.completion != CompletionStrategy::None`
- [ ] `resolve_outcome` returns `"cancelled"` when `outcome` is `None`, `completion == None`, and `target_state.terminal == true`
- [ ] `resolve_outcome` returns `"needs_input"` when `outcome` is `None`, `completion == None`, and `target_state.terminal == false`
- [ ] Every `[[workflow.states.transitions]]` block in `apm-core/src/default/workflow.toml` contains an explicit `outcome` field
- [ ] `apm validate` emits a `warning:` line (not an error) when the workflow has no reachable `success` outcome from any agent-actionable state
- [ ] `apm validate` exits 0 (success) when the dead-end warning is the only issue
- [ ] Unit tests in `apm-core/src/config.rs` cover all four `resolve_outcome` branches, each as a separate `#[test]`
- [ ] A test asserts that every transition in the default workflow reports a non-empty outcome string via `resolve_outcome`
- [ ] A validate test covers the dead-end-warning path (workflow with an agent-actionable state but no reachable `success` transition)
- [ ] A validate test asserts the dead-end warning is absent for the default workflow (which has a reachable `success` via `in_progress -> implemented`)

### Out of scope

- Mock wrappers (`mock-happy`, `mock-sad`, `mock-random`) reading the `outcome` field — ticket 25c92daa
- `apm validate --fix` auto-populating `outcome` on project `workflow.toml` files (implicit defaults make migration unnecessary)
- Supervisor UI colouring transitions by outcome
- JSON Schema / schemars export changes (automatic via `#[derive(JsonSchema)]` already on `TransitionConfig`)
- Per-profile dead-end analysis in `apm validate` (this ticket warns at global workflow level only; per-profile is a possible follow-up)
- Rejecting unknown outcome values at parse time (custom strings are accepted; tooling treats them as non-success)

### Approach

Five changes across three files: add the `outcome` field to `TransitionConfig`, add the `resolve_outcome` free function, annotate every default-workflow transition with an explicit outcome, add a dead-end reachability warning to `apm validate`, and add the corresponding tests.

#### 1. `apm-core/src/config.rs` — add field to `TransitionConfig`

Add after the `profile` field (~line 365):

```rust
/// Semantic outcome of this transition from the worker's perspective.
/// Recognised values: `success`, `needs_input`, `blocked`, `rejected`, `cancelled`.
/// Custom values are accepted but treated as non-success by tooling.
/// When omitted, `resolve_outcome` applies implicit defaults; see that function.
#[serde(default)]
pub outcome: Option<String>,
```

#### 2. `apm-core/src/config.rs` — add `resolve_outcome`

Add as a free function at module level (not inside `impl`), below the struct definitions:

```rust
/// Returns the effective outcome label for `transition`.
///
/// Uses the explicit `outcome` field when set; otherwise applies implicit defaults in order:
/// 1. `completion` strategy is set (non-`None`) → `"success"`
/// 2. `target_state.terminal` is true → `"cancelled"`
/// 3. Otherwise → `"needs_input"`
pub fn resolve_outcome<'a>(
    transition: &'a TransitionConfig,
    target_state: &StateConfig,
) -> &'a str {
    if let Some(ref o) = transition.outcome {
        return o.as_str();
    }
    if transition.completion != CompletionStrategy::None {
        return "success";
    }
    if target_state.terminal {
        return "cancelled";
    }
    "needs_input"
}
```

The static string returns (`"success"` etc.) coerce to `&'a str` because `'static: 'a`.

#### 3. `apm-core/src/default/workflow.toml` — annotate every transition

Add `outcome = "<value>"` to each `[[workflow.states.transitions]]` block. The mapping rule matches the implicit defaults exactly, so these annotations are self-documenting, not overrides:

| Condition | `outcome` value |
|---|---|
| transition has `completion` set | `"success"` |
| target state is `closed` (terminal) | `"cancelled"` |
| all other transitions | `"needs_input"` |

No transition in the default workflow uses `rejected` or `blocked` explicitly — those values exist for project-level customisation. Every explicit value set here matches what `resolve_outcome` would infer anyway.

Mapping for each transition (implementer: verify `completion` field in the file before writing; `completion`-carrying transitions are the authoritative source of `"success"`):

- `new → groomed` (no completion, non-terminal) → `"needs_input"`
- `new → closed` (terminal) → `"cancelled"`
- `groomed → in_design` (no completion, non-terminal) → `"needs_input"`
- `groomed → closed` → `"cancelled"`
- `question → groomed` → `"needs_input"`
- `question → closed` → `"cancelled"`
- `specd → ready` → `"needs_input"`
- `specd → ammend` → `"needs_input"`
- `specd → closed` → `"cancelled"`
- `ammend → specd` → `"needs_input"`
- `ammend → question` → `"needs_input"`
- `ammend → in_design` → `"needs_input"`
- `ammend → closed` → `"cancelled"`
- `in_design → specd` — if `completion` is set → `"success"`, else `"needs_input"`
- `in_design → question` → `"needs_input"`
- `in_design → ammend` → `"needs_input"`
- `in_design → closed` → `"cancelled"`
- `ready → in_progress` — if `completion` is set → `"success"`, else `"needs_input"`
- `ready → ammend` → `"needs_input"`
- `ready → specd` → `"needs_input"`
- `ready → closed` → `"cancelled"`
- `in_progress → implemented` — has `completion` (merge or pr_or_epic_merge) → `"success"`
- `in_progress → blocked` → `"needs_input"`
- `in_progress → ready` → `"needs_input"`
- `in_progress → ammend` → `"needs_input"`
- `in_progress → closed` → `"cancelled"`
- `blocked → ready` → `"needs_input"`
- `blocked → closed` → `"cancelled"`
- `implemented → ready` → `"needs_input"`
- `implemented → ammend` → `"needs_input"`
- `implemented → in_progress` → `"needs_input"`
- `implemented → closed` → `"cancelled"`
- `merge_failed → implemented` — check `completion`; apply rule
- `merge_failed → in_progress` → `"needs_input"`

#### 4. `apm-core/src/validate.rs` — dead-end warning in `validate_warnings`

Extend `validate_warnings(config: &Config) -> Vec<String>` with a reachability check after the existing docker check:

```
1. Build HashMap<&str, &StateConfig> indexed by state.id for O(1) target lookup.
2. Collect agent-startable state IDs: states where actionable contains "agent" or "any".
   If no such states exist, skip the check — the workflow may be supervisor-only by design.
3. BFS from each startable state ID, tracking visited state IDs to avoid cycles.
   For each visited state, iterate its transitions:
   - Call resolve_outcome(t, lookup[t.to]) for each transition t.
   - If any result == "success": success is reachable — return without warning.
   - Otherwise enqueue t.to if not yet visited.
4. If BFS completes without finding a "success" outcome, push:
   "workflow has no reachable 'success' outcome from any agent-actionable state; \
    workers may never complete successfully"
```

This is O(states × transitions) — negligible for real workflows.

#### 5. Tests

**`apm-core/src/config.rs` `#[cfg(test)]`** — four new unit tests for `resolve_outcome`:

- `resolve_outcome_explicit_override`: `outcome = Some("rejected")`, `completion = None`, non-terminal target → `"rejected"`
- `resolve_outcome_implicit_success`: `outcome = None`, `completion = Merge`, any target → `"success"`
- `resolve_outcome_implicit_cancelled`: `outcome = None`, `completion = None`, `target.terminal = true` → `"cancelled"`
- `resolve_outcome_implicit_needs_input`: `outcome = None`, `completion = None`, `target.terminal = false` → `"needs_input"`

Construct minimal `TransitionConfig` and `StateConfig` values inline; set only the fields each test cares about.

**`apm-core/src/init.rs` or `apm-core/src/config.rs`** — extend `default_workflow_toml_is_valid` or add a sibling test:

Parse the default workflow; build a state-by-id map; for each state's transitions, call `resolve_outcome(t, target)`; assert the result is one of `["success", "needs_input", "blocked", "rejected", "cancelled"]`. This guards against future regressions.

**`apm-core/src/validate.rs` `#[cfg(test)]`** — two new tests:

- `dead_end_workflow_warning_emitted`: construct a minimal `Config` with one `actionable = ["agent"]` state whose only transition leads to a non-terminal, no-completion state with no further exit. Assert `validate_warnings` returns a vec whose first item contains the string `"success"`.
- `default_workflow_no_dead_end_warning`: load the default config (same helper used by existing tests). Assert no item in `validate_warnings` is the dead-end warning string, since `in_progress → implemented` with `completion = merge` is reachable from the agent-actionable `in_progress` state.

### 1. `apm-core/src/config.rs` — add field to `TransitionConfig`

Add after the `profile` field (~line 365):

```rust
/// Semantic outcome of this transition from the worker's perspective.
/// Recognised values: `success`, `needs_input`, `blocked`, `rejected`, `cancelled`.
/// Custom values are accepted but treated as non-success by tooling.
/// When omitted, `resolve_outcome` applies implicit defaults; see that function.
#[serde(default)]
pub outcome: Option<String>,
```

### 2. `apm-core/src/config.rs` — add `resolve_outcome`

Add as a free function at module level (not inside `impl`), below the struct definitions:

```rust
/// Returns the effective outcome label for `transition`.
///
/// Uses the explicit `outcome` field when set; otherwise applies implicit defaults in order:
/// 1. `completion` strategy is set (non-`None`) → `"success"`
/// 2. `target_state.terminal` is true → `"cancelled"`
/// 3. Otherwise → `"needs_input"`
pub fn resolve_outcome<'a>(
    transition: &'a TransitionConfig,
    target_state: &StateConfig,
) -> &'a str {
    if let Some(ref o) = transition.outcome {
        return o.as_str();
    }
    if transition.completion != CompletionStrategy::None {
        return "success";
    }
    if target_state.terminal {
        return "cancelled";
    }
    "needs_input"
}
```

The static string returns (`"success"` etc.) coerce to `&'a str` because `'static: 'a`.

### 3. `apm-core/src/default/workflow.toml` — annotate every transition

Add `outcome = "<value>"` to each `[[workflow.states.transitions]]` block. The mapping rule matches the implicit defaults exactly, so these annotations are self-documenting, not overrides:

| Condition | `outcome` value |
|---|---|
| transition has `completion` set | `"success"` |
| target state is `closed` (terminal) | `"cancelled"` |
| all other transitions | `"needs_input"` |

No transition in the default workflow uses `rejected` or `blocked` explicitly — those values exist for project-level customisation. Every explicit value set here matches what `resolve_outcome` would infer anyway.

Mapping for each transition (implementer: verify `completion` field in the file before writing; `completion`-carrying transitions are the authoritative source of `"success"`):

- `new → groomed` (no completion, non-terminal) → `"needs_input"`
- `new → closed` (terminal) → `"cancelled"`
- `groomed → in_design` (no completion, non-terminal) → `"needs_input"`
- `groomed → closed` → `"cancelled"`
- `question → groomed` → `"needs_input"`
- `question → closed` → `"cancelled"`
- `specd → ready` → `"needs_input"`
- `specd → ammend` → `"needs_input"`
- `specd → closed` → `"cancelled"`
- `ammend → specd` → `"needs_input"`
- `ammend → question` → `"needs_input"`
- `ammend → in_design` → `"needs_input"`
- `ammend → closed` → `"cancelled"`
- `in_design → specd` — if `completion` is set → `"success"`, else `"needs_input"`
- `in_design → question` → `"needs_input"`
- `in_design → ammend` → `"needs_input"`
- `in_design → closed` → `"cancelled"`
- `ready → in_progress` — if `completion` is set → `"success"`, else `"needs_input"`
- `ready → ammend` → `"needs_input"`
- `ready → specd` → `"needs_input"`
- `ready → closed` → `"cancelled"`
- `in_progress → implemented` — has `completion` (merge or pr_or_epic_merge) → `"success"`
- `in_progress → blocked` → `"needs_input"`
- `in_progress → ready` → `"needs_input"`
- `in_progress → ammend` → `"needs_input"`
- `in_progress → closed` → `"cancelled"`
- `blocked → ready` → `"needs_input"`
- `blocked → closed` → `"cancelled"`
- `implemented → ready` → `"needs_input"`
- `implemented → ammend` → `"needs_input"`
- `implemented → in_progress` → `"needs_input"`
- `implemented → closed` → `"cancelled"`
- `merge_failed → implemented` — check `completion`; apply rule
- `merge_failed → in_progress` → `"needs_input"`

### 4. `apm-core/src/validate.rs` — dead-end warning in `validate_warnings`

Extend `validate_warnings(config: &Config) -> Vec<String>` with a reachability check. Insert after the existing docker check:

```
1. Build HashMap<&str, &StateConfig> indexed by state.id for O(1) target lookup.
2. Collect agent-startable state IDs: states where actionable contains "agent" or "any".
3. BFS from each startable state ID, tracking visited state IDs to avoid cycles.
   For each visited state, iterate its transitions:
   - Call resolve_outcome(t, lookup[t.to]) for each transition t.
   - If any result == "success": success is reachable — skip the warning entirely.
   - Otherwise enqueue t.to if not yet visited.
4. If BFS completes without finding a "success" outcome, push:
   "workflow has no reachable 'success' outcome from any agent-actionable state; \
    workers may never complete successfully"
```

This is O(states × transitions) — negligible for real workflows.

Note: skip the check (no warning) if there are no agent-startable states at all, since the workflow may be supervisor-only by design.

### 5. Tests

**`apm-core/src/config.rs` `#[cfg(test)]`** — four new unit tests for `resolve_outcome`:

- `resolve_outcome_explicit_override`: `outcome = Some("rejected")`, `completion = None`, non-terminal target → `"rejected"`
- `resolve_outcome_implicit_success`: `outcome = None`, `completion = Merge`, any target → `"success"`
- `resolve_outcome_implicit_cancelled`: `outcome = None`, `completion = None`, `target.terminal = true` → `"cancelled"`
- `resolve_outcome_implicit_needs_input`: `outcome = None`, `completion = None`, `target.terminal = false` → `"needs_input"`

Construct minimal `TransitionConfig` and `StateConfig` values inline (derive `Default` if needed or set each field explicitly).

**`apm-core/src/init.rs` or `apm-core/src/config.rs`** — extend `default_workflow_toml_is_valid` or add a sibling test:

Parse the default workflow; build a state-by-id map; for each state's transitions, call `resolve_outcome(t, target)`; assert the result is one of `["success", "needs_input", "blocked", "rejected", "cancelled"]`. This guards against future regressions that produce an unexpected outcome string.

**`apm-core/src/validate.rs` `#[cfg(test)]`** — two new tests:

- `dead_end_workflow_warning_emitted`: construct a minimal `Config` with one `actionable = ["agent"]` state whose only transition leads to another non-terminal, no-completion state (forming a cycle with no success exit). Assert `validate_warnings` returns a vec containing a string with `"success"` in the dead-end warning message.
- `default_workflow_no_dead_end_warning`: load the default config (same helper used by existing tests). Assert no item in `validate_warnings` is the dead-end warning string — the default workflow has `in_progress → implemented` with `completion = merge`, which is reachable from `in_progress` (actionable by agents).

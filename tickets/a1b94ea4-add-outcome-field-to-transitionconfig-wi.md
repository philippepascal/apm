## Spec

### Problem

The `TransitionConfig` struct in `apm-core/src/config.rs` has no `outcome` field. Any tooling that needs to know whether a transition represents the worker's success path — mock wrappers, dead-end detection in `apm validate`, future UI colouring — must each re-implement the same inference from `CompletionStrategy` and `StateConfig.terminal`. That logic has a canonical definition in `docs/agent-wrappers.md` § "Transition outcomes," but it lives only in prose, not in code.

Adding `pub outcome: Option<String>` to `TransitionConfig` together with a single `resolve_outcome` helper centralises the inference once. Projects that want a more precise label (e.g. marking a transition to `ammend` as `rejected` rather than the inferred `needs_input`) can set the field explicitly; the helper returns the explicit value when present and falls back to the three-rule inference otherwise.

This ticket's scope is the data model and its rules. The field is deliberately inert in the current binary: mock wrappers that read it are a separate ticket (25c92daa). The value delivered here is (a) a stable, typed schema that downstream consumers can rely on without re-deriving the logic, (b) a `resolve_outcome` helper they can call directly, and (c) an annotated `workflow.toml` that makes the shipped default self-describing.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `TransitionConfig` has a `pub outcome: Option<String>` field with `#[serde(default)]` and a doc comment citing the five recognised values
- [ ] A public `resolve_outcome<'a>(transition: &'a TransitionConfig, target_state: &StateConfig) -> &'a str` function exists in `apm-core`
- [ ] `resolve_outcome` returns the explicit outcome string (as `&str`) when `transition.outcome` is `Some`
- [ ] `resolve_outcome` returns `"success"` when `outcome` is `None` and `transition.completion != CompletionStrategy::None`
- [ ] `resolve_outcome` returns `"cancelled"` when `outcome` is `None`, `completion == None`, and `target_state.terminal == true`
- [ ] `resolve_outcome` returns `"needs_input"` when `outcome` is `None`, `completion == None`, and `target_state.terminal == false`
- [ ] Every `[[workflow.states.transitions]]` block in `apm-core/src/default/workflow.toml` contains an explicit `outcome` field
- [ ] `apm validate` emits a `warning:` line (not an error) when the workflow has no reachable `success` outcome from any agent-actionable state
- [ ] `apm validate` exits 0 (success) when the dead-end warning is the only issue
- [ ] Unit tests in `apm-core/src/config.rs` cover all four `resolve_outcome` branches, each as a separate `#[test]`
- [ ] A test asserts that every transition in the default workflow reports a non-empty outcome string via `resolve_outcome`
- [ ] A validate test covers the dead-end-warning path (workflow with an agent-actionable state but no reachable `success` transition)
- [ ] A validate test asserts the dead-end warning is absent for the default workflow (which has a reachable `success` via `in_progress -> implemented`)

### Out of scope

- Mock wrappers (`mock-happy`, `mock-sad`, `mock-random`) reading the `outcome` field — ticket 25c92daa
- `apm validate --fix` auto-populating `outcome` on project `workflow.toml` files (implicit defaults make migration unnecessary)
- Supervisor UI colouring transitions by outcome
- JSON Schema / schemars export changes (automatic via `#[derive(JsonSchema)]` already on `TransitionConfig`)
- Per-profile dead-end analysis in `apm validate` (this ticket warns at global workflow level only; per-profile is a possible follow-up)
- Rejecting unknown outcome values at parse time (custom strings are accepted; tooling treats them as non-success)

## Spec

### Problem

`apm validate` currently enforces that transition targets exist, that terminal states have no outgoing edges, and that merge completions have `on_failure` set. It does not check three structural properties that, when violated, produce silently broken dispatch behaviour at runtime:

1. **Trigger uniqueness.** A `command:start` transition marks its destination state as a fresh dispatch point. If a second transition (manual or otherwise) can also land on that state, being in the state no longer reliably means the dispatcher should act — the flag becomes ambiguous. No error is emitted today when two transitions converge on the same `command:start` target.

2. **`worker_profile` shape.** Dispatch reads `state.worker_profile` and splits on `/` to extract the agent name and role. A value without a `/`, with empty halves, or with the reserved role `worker` causes a runtime panic or silently falls back to the wrong wrapper. The field is currently accepted without format validation.

3. **`command:start` → dispatch-capable state.** A `command:start` transition that targets a state with no `worker_profile` gives the dispatcher nothing to spawn. This is caught at runtime (no agent is launched) rather than at config-load time.

All three checks are pure additive validation in `validate_config_no_agents`. No existing API changes, no new config fields — malformed `workflow.toml` files are rejected with clear, actionable error messages instead of failing silently at dispatch time.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `apm validate` reports an error when two transitions both target the same state and one of them uses `trigger = "command:start"`, and the error message names both source states and the destination state.
- [ ] `apm validate` reports an error when a manual transition and a `command:start` transition both target the same state, and the error message names both source states.
- [ ] `apm validate` reports an error when a state declares `worker_profile = "claude/worker"` (reserved role).
- [ ] `apm validate` reports an error when a state declares `worker_profile` with no `/` separator (e.g. `"claudecoder"`).
- [ ] `apm validate` reports an error when a state declares `worker_profile` with an empty agent component (e.g. `"/coder"`).
- [ ] `apm validate` reports an error when a state declares `worker_profile` with an empty role component (e.g. `"claude/"`).
- [ ] `apm validate` reports an error when a `command:start` transition targets a state that has no `worker_profile` set.
- [ ] `apm validate` reports no errors for the default `workflow.toml` (as it stands after ticket 071886fc).

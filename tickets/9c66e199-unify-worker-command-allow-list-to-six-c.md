## Spec

### Problem

The `role_command_allowlist` function in `apm-core/src/instructions.rs` hard-codes two named roles — `"spec-writer"` and `"worker"` — each with its own 8-command list. Any role not matching those two strings (including `"coder"`) falls through to `None` and receives the full, unfiltered command list of 30+ entries. A coder agent today sees supervisor commands like `apm sync`, `apm list`, `apm next`, and `apm start` in its Command Reference — noise at best, misleading at worst.

Beyond the coder gap, the design is fragile: adding a new role requires editing match arms in code. Per project convention, role names belong in config, not in code. Both role lists also include supervisor-tier commands (`sync`, `list`, `next`) that workers should never invoke.

The fix is to replace the per-role match arms with a single `WORKER_COMMAND_ALLOWLIST` constant returned for any supplied role. The six commands — `show`, `state`, `spec`, `set`, `new`, `instructions` — cover everything a worker needs: reading the ticket, transitioning state, editing the spec, adjusting fields, filing side-notes, and bootstrapping the session. No role-name strings belong in the filtering logic after this change.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `apm instructions --role coder` Command Reference lists exactly the six commands: show, state, spec, set, new, instructions
- [ ] `apm instructions --role spec-writer` Command Reference lists the same six commands as coder
- [ ] `apm instructions --role any-unknown-role` Command Reference lists the same six commands
- [ ] `apm instructions` (no role) Command Reference remains unfiltered
- [ ] The literal strings `"spec-writer"` and `"worker"` do not appear in the command-filtering logic of `instructions.rs`
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace` passes with updated test assertions
- [ ] `apm.coder.md` (default and project copy) Permitted commands section lists: show, state, spec, set, new, instructions
- [ ] `apm.spec-writer.md` (default and project copy) Permitted commands section lists: show, state, spec, set, new, instructions

## Spec

### Problem

The workflow state intended to request spec or implementation revisions is named `ammend` throughout the codebase — in the workflow TOML, Rust source, tests, agent instructions, and documentation. The correct English spelling is `amend`. The misspelling propagated from the initial workflow definition and was copied into every layer that references the state by name.

Because the state ID is a bare string used in comparisons, config files, TOML fixtures, and user-facing help text, the misspelling appears in the interface agents and supervisors see every time they interact with this state. Fixing it corrects the language without changing any behaviour.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `apm state <id> amend` transitions a ticket to the `amend` state
- [ ] `apm review <id> --to amend` transitions a ticket to the `amend` state
- [ ] `apm instructions` output contains `amend` (not `ammend`) in the state machine table
- [ ] `apm list` and `apm show` display `amend` for tickets in that state
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace` passes with no references to `ammend` remaining in source
- [ ] The default `workflow.toml` embedded in `apm-core` defines the state id as `amend`
- [ ] The project's `.apm/workflow.toml` defines the state id as `amend`
- [ ] Agent instruction files (`.apm/agents/` and `apm-core/src/default/agents/`) reference `amend` only

### Out of scope

- Archive ticket files under `archive/` — historical records, not live data
- Ticket branch names that happen to contain the word `ammend` in their slug (branch names are load-bearing and cannot be renamed)
- The title of this ticket itself (slug is frozen in the branch name)
- Any occurrences in `tickets/` Markdown files currently in states other than `amend` (none presently in that state, so no migration is needed)

### Approach

This is a pure string-rename across all active source files. No logic changes. No migration needed — `grep -rn 'state = "ammend"' tickets/` returns nothing, so no live tickets are in this state.

Run `grep -rn "ammend" . --include="*.rs" --include="*.toml" --include="*.md" | grep -v archive/ | grep -v ".git/"` after each step to confirm coverage.

#### Workflow TOML files (define the canonical state ID)

- **`apm-core/src/default/workflow.toml`** — rename `id = "ammend"` → `"amend"`, `label = "Ammend"` → `"Amend"`, both `to = "ammend"` → `"amend"`. This is the embedded default copied into new projects by `apm init`.
- **`.apm/workflow.toml`** — identical changes. This is the live project workflow.

#### Rust source files

- **`apm-core/src/state.rs`** — two string comparisons: `old_state == "ammend"` → `"amend"`, `new_state == "ammend"` → `"amend"`.
- **`apm-core/src/instructions.rs`** — two lines in `STATIC_STATE_MACHINE`: `"ammend"` → `"amend"` (both the state ID and the command example).
- **`apm-core/src/config.rs`** — two test fixture literals: `to = "ammend"` → `"amend"`, `id = "ammend"` → `"amend"`, and `label = "Ammend"` → `"Amend"`.
- **`apm-core/src/init.rs`** — three occurrences in `default_workflow_toml_is_valid` test: all `"ammend"` → `"amend"`.
- **`apm-core/src/epic.rs`** — four occurrences: state string in test fixture data, test function name `epic_is_quiescent_ammend_with_impl_history_blocks` → `epic_is_quiescent_amend_with_impl_history_blocks`, and two assertion message strings.
- **`apm/src/main.rs`** — one occurrence in help text: `--to ammend` → `--to amend`.
- **`apm/src/cmd/review.rs`** — one string comparison: `Some("ammend")` → `Some("amend")`.
- **`apm-server/src/workers.rs`** — one occurrence in an excluded-states array: `"ammend"` → `"amend"`.
- **`apm-server/src/main.rs`** — one occurrence in a test assertion string: `"ammend"` → `"amend"`.

#### Test files

- **`apm/tests/integration.rs`** — several occurrences across multiple tests: state strings in state arrays, TOML fixture literals, test function names (`state_ammend_inserts_amendment_section` → `state_amend_inserts_amendment_section`, `spawn_ammend_ticket_transitions_to_in_design` → `spawn_amend_ticket_transitions_to_in_design`, `review_ammend_normalises_plain_bullets_to_checkboxes` → `review_amend_normalises_plain_bullets_to_checkboxes`), and inline comments.
- **`apm/tests/e2e.rs`** — one TOML fixture literal: `id = "ammend"` → `"amend"`.

#### Agent instruction Markdown files

- **`.apm/agents/claude/apm.main-agent.md`** — three occurrences in transition examples and the "amend a ticket" section.
- **`.apm/agents/claude/apm.spec-writer.md`** — three occurrences in the handling-ammend section header and body.
- **`apm-core/src/default/agents/claude/apm.main-agent.md`** — same three as above (this is the embedded copy).
- **`apm-core/src/default/agents/claude/apm.spec-writer.md`** — same three as above (this is the embedded copy).

#### Documentation and README

- **`docs/commands.md`** — two occurrences in the `apm review` section.
- **`docs/agent-wrappers.md`** — two occurrences in the example workflow config and surrounding prose.
- **`README.md`** — three occurrences in the workflow diagram and narrative text.

#### Verification

After all changes, run:
1. `grep -rn "ammend" . --include="*.rs" --include="*.toml" --include="*.md" | grep -v archive/ | grep -v ".git/"` — must return zero hits (only the ticket's own branch-name slug is exempt, and that doesn't appear in source files).
2. `cargo test --workspace` — all tests must pass.

### Open questions


### Amendment requests

- [ ] Acknowledge the downstream back-compat breakage. apm-core/src/state.rs:111 and :166 match the bare literal "ammend" to gate BEHAVIOUR, not just display — line 111 gates the 'all amendment requests must be checked before resubmitting to specd' validation; line 166 gates ensure_amendment_section() insertion. Because the state id is read from workflow.toml at runtime, any external repo whose workflow.toml still says 'ammend' will keep transitioning but SILENTLY lose these two behaviours after upgrading the binary. The spec frames this as a pure string rename with no migration; it must call this out as a known breaking change for downstream repos (reference the existing migration-docs ticket 68829abb).

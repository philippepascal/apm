## Spec

### Problem

When a worker can't complete its task because of a tool limitation, permission denial, missing dependency, or unforeseen blocker, today there is no clear escape hatch. The worker either: (a) improvises off-topic work (the side-quest pattern from the 2026-04-30 incident on ticket 2803bf07, where a permission prompt led the worker to invoke the `fewer-permission-prompts` skill and try to edit settings.json); (b) gives up silently and exits without transitioning state, leaving the ticket stuck in `in_design` or `in_progress`; or (c) crashes outright.

The cleanest path is the one already in the workflow: `question` state for spec-writers, `blocked` state for impl-agents. Both are `actionable = ["supervisor"]`, so the supervisor sees them in the queue and can intervene. The `### Open questions` section is the standard place to document what was needed.

Today the agent instructions (`.apm/agents.md`, `.apm/apm.spec-writer.md`, `.apm/apm.worker.md`) cover the case of being blocked on an *ambiguity* ("write the question in Open questions, then `apm state <id> question`"). They do not cover the case of being blocked on a *capability limitation* — the kind of blocker that pushed the 2803bf07 worker into a side-quest instead of a clean exit.

This ticket adds an explicit "## Capability limitations" section to the spec-writer and worker instruction files covering exactly this case, and a pointer sentence in the project-wide `agents.md` conventions file.

### Acceptance criteria

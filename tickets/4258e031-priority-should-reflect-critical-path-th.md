## Spec

### Problem

Once `depends_on` is in use, the raw priority score of a blocking ticket no longer reflects its true urgency. A root dependency with low priority sits near the bottom of the queue and of `apm next` scoring, even if it is blocking a chain of high-value work. There is no visual or scheduling signal that dispatching it first matters.

The correct effective priority of any ticket is `max(own_priority, max priority of all direct and transitive dependents)`. For example: if A (priority 2) blocks B (priority 9), A's effective priority should be 9 — dispatching A first is what unlocks B.

Without critical-path elevation, the priority queue and `apm next` give a misleading picture once dependency graphs are in use. Agents and supervisors have to manually reason about the graph instead of trusting the queue order.

### Acceptance criteria

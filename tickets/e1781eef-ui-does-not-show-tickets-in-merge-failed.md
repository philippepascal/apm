## Spec

### Problem

The local `.apm/workflow.toml` does not include a `merge_failed` state entry. The state was added to `apm-core/src/default/workflow.toml` in commit `a7bce26b`, but the project-local config was never updated.

When `apm-server` handles `GET /api/tickets`, it builds `supervisor_states` by scanning only `cfg.workflow.states` — the locally loaded config. Because `merge_failed` is absent from that config, it is absent from `supervisor_states` in the API response (`apm-server/src/handlers/tickets.rs`, lines 52–57). `SupervisorView.tsx` uses `supervisorStates` (from the API) as the source of truth for which swimlane columns to render; no entry means no column is created. The tickets themselves ARE present in the payload (they are not terminal and therefore survive the `tickets.retain(…)` filter), but the UI creates no column to hold them, so they silently vanish from the board.

Two secondary gaps compound the problem:

- `ALL_WORKFLOW_STATES` in `SupervisorView.tsx` (lines 8–20) is a hardcoded list used exclusively for the state filter dropdown. `merge_failed` is not in it, so the supervisor cannot filter for that state to discover the hidden tickets.
- `stateColors.ts` has no entry for `merge_failed`. If the ticket did appear, it would render with the default gray rather than a visually prominent error colour.

The hardcoded fallback `supervisor_states` in `tickets.rs` (lines 41–44), used when config loading fails, also omits `merge_failed`, so the invisibility persists even in degraded mode.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A ticket in `merge_failed` state appears as a swimlane column in the supervisor board when at least one such ticket exists, without any changes to `.apm/workflow.toml`.
- [ ] The `merge_failed` swimlane column uses the RED colour scheme (same as `blocked`), signalling that supervisor action is required.
- [ ] The state filter dropdown in SupervisorView lists `merge_failed` as a selectable option when at least one such ticket exists (dropdown is derived from `supervisorStates` rather than a hardcoded array).
- [ ] When workflow config fails to load, the server fallback still includes `merge_failed` in `supervisor_states`.
- [ ] Any other non-terminal ticket state present in the ticket list but absent from the workflow config is automatically surfaced as a swimlane column, with no further code changes required.
- [ ] The `/api/tickets` response payload includes tickets in `merge_failed` state (server does not strip them).
